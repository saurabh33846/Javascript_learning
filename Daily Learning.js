Ways to vertically center an element: http://vanseodesign.com/css/vertical-centering/


When both left and right are defined, if not prevented from doing so by other properties, the element will stretch to satisfy both. 
If the element cannot stretch to satisfy both -- for example, if a width is declared -- the position of the element is over-constrained. 
When this is the case, the left value has precedence when the container is left-to-right; the right value has precedence when the container 
is right-to-left.

When both top and bottom are specified, position is set to absolute or fixed, and height is unspecified (either auto or 100%) both the top and 
bottom distances are respected. In all other situations, if height is constrained in any way or position is set to relative, the top property 
takes precedence and the bottom property is ignored.
